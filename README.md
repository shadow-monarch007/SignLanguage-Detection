# 🧠 Sign Language Detection ✋🤖

A deep learning-based project that detects and interprets sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

📌 Features

- Real-time sign language detection  
- Preprocessing using OpenCV  
- Trained CNN model for classification  
- Easy-to-use GUI (if applicable)  
- Custom dataset support
  
🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- MediaPipe (if used)  

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/shadow-monarch007/SignLanguage-Detection.git
cd SignLanguage-Detection
```

2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there's no requirements.txt, install manually:

```
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

3. Run the project

```
python your_main_file.py
```

Replace `your_main_file.py` with your actual main file name like `app.py` or `main.py`.
